*What do People Sing? Findings in R&B,Metal and Rap song lyrics*

## Intro 

Music is a universal language that transcends cultural barriers and speaks to the human experience in myriad ways. While the melodies and rhythms may vary across genres, the lyrics remain a core component that artists leverage to convey their messages, emotions, and perspectives. This post delves into the nuanced world of lyrical content, exploring how different genres like metal, R&B, and rap favor certain words and themes over others.

Through a meticulous analysis of a diverse selection of songs, we'll uncover the linguistic patterns that define each genre's lyrical landscape. Metal, with its raw intensity and rebellious spirit, may lean towards words that evoke power, aggression, and societal commentary. R&B, known for its soulful melodies and emotive storytelling, could embrace vocabulary that touches on matters of the heart, relationships, and personal growth. Rap, a genre rooted in urban culture and self-expression, may gravitate towards words that reflect struggle, resilience, and the gritty realities of life.

By dissecting the lyrical choices made by artists across these vastly different genres, we aim to gain a deeper appreciation for the artistry and intentionality behind their wordsmithing. This exploration promises to shed light on the unique perspectives and experiences that shape the musical narratives we connect with on a profound level.
