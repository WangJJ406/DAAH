When we look into the marvellous pieces in the museums, do you see the "tags" behind? Cultural Heritage has a myriad of labels behind it. Although these labels cannot replace the meaning and value of Cultural Heritage itself, they show us the connection of the artifacts. This project focuses on analyzing the textual descriptions of Cultural Heritage, analyzing the number of keyword occurrences and visualizing them with wordcloud, in order to find the similarities and differences between different cultures.

## Part 1 - From the Webpage and CSV File

The Harvard Art Museums website has an aesthetically pleasing design. However, I don't think it does a good job of guiding non-specialists through the process of exploring and learning about Cultural Heritage because the site doesn't do a great job of proactively recommending exhibits that, for the most part, one would need to search for on their own to explore. Of course, the filter function of the website is good to stimulate people's desire to explore. It puts filters on some of the dimensions so that we can limit out the scope of what we want and thus focus more on wanting to understand the parts. However, until one clicks through to a specific presentation of an artifact, all of the artifacts in the site are presented in an image arrangement, which makes it difficult to see a complete overview, and instead focuses more on each individual.

It is also hard to grasp the general idea of the cultural heritages in a certain period of time, culture, location, or any other categories in the filters just from the csv. file because all of them are listed individually and the file is too big for human to directly retrieve information from it.
