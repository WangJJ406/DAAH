When we look into the marvellous pieces in the museums, do you see the "tags" behind? Cultural Heritage has a myriad of labels behind it. Although these labels cannot replace the meaning and value of Cultural Heritage itself, they show us the connection of the artifacts. This project focuses on analyzing the textual descriptions of Cultural Heritage, analyzing the number of keyword occurrences and visualizing them with wordcloud, in order to find the similarities and differences between different cultures.

## Part 1 - From the Webpage

The Harvard Art Museums website has an aesthetically pleasing design. However, I don't think it does a good job of guiding non-specialists through the process of exploring and learning about Cultural Heritage because the site doesn't do a great job of proactively recommending exhibits that, for the most part, one would need to search for on their own to explore. Of course, the filter function of the website is good to stimulate people's desire to explore. It connects Cultural Heritage to each other, showing some common qualities and making it easier for users to find cultural similarities!
