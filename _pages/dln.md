## Course Reflection



Last November, as I was navigating through the Albert course selection system in search of elective courses outside my major, I stumbled upon "Digital Humanities." The term immediately caught my attention, especially since my friends majoring in humanities had long encouraged me to explore their field before graduating. Now in my third year, opportunities to diversify my academic experiences were dwindling, prompting me to think, "Why not?" That decision marked my entry into the intriguing world of Digital Humanities.

Upon attending the first class, I was pleasantly surprised to find a substantial number of non-majors among us. Students from diverse disciplines such as Computer Science, Information Management, Business, and others had come together to delve into Digital Humanities, a subject new to most of us. Initially, I presumed Digital Humanities primarily involved the integration of humanities into digital spaces. However, I soon discovered its focus was more on leveraging digitalization to enhance the study of humanities and arts, offering fresh perspectives on traditional topics. Digital tools empower researchers with advanced capabilities in numerical computation and data analytics. In the context of marketing, for instance, digital marketing techniques enable more effective monitoring of consumer behavior and tailoring of individual experiences.

The field of Digital Arts and Humanities has proven to be a fertile ground for collaboration among individuals from various backgrounds. This multidisciplinary nature stems from its requirement for a broad spectrum of skills. The field benefits from the technical prowess of students with Computer Science and Data Science backgrounds, who handle the analysis of extensive datasets. Meanwhile, individuals from the humanities and arts contribute valuable insights, guiding the direction of research with their deep understanding and intuition. Business students like myself are also welcomed, as we apply analytical frameworks from our field to examine the impact of societal trends, politics, and technology on cultural and technological evolutions.

A notable example of innovation within Digital Humanities is the Word Cloud. This tool visualizes the frequency of keywords within a text, with word size indicating frequency and colors sometimes representing categories. The Word Cloud facilitates a novel approach to digesting lengthy documents, offering a summary through keywords rather than requiring sequential reading. This advancement significantly enhances the efficiency of researching, allowing for quick comparisons between articles at a glance.

Another powerful technique utilized in Digital Humanities is Digital Information Systems (DIS). DIS enables the reorganization and presentation of spatial data on maps using GPS coordinates. Information from disparate sources but sharing common locations can be integrated into a single map, allowing for multifaceted insights at specific locales. Through DIS, patterns are revealed, and predictions can be made on a broad geographical scale, enhancing our understanding of spatial relationships and trends.

Another critical aspect of Digital Humanities is result visualization. The field often deals with complex datasets that defy simple textual or graphical representation. Hence, there's a growing need for advanced visual outputs, such as animated visuals and interactive maps, to effectively communicate research findings.

The inclusive culture of Digital Humanities also plays an important role in its growth. The field thrives on the diverse professional skills, attitudes, personalities, and cultural backgrounds of its participants. The emphasis on social interaction and collaboration is evident in the classroom, where group projects and open discussions are common. These interactions allow participants to view issues from varied perspectives and explore ideas previously unconsidered. For instance, discussing the socio-educational status of Middle Asian regions with peers who have lived experiences in those areas offers eye-opening insights that challenge preconceived notions.

Despite its relative youth as a discipline, Digital Humanities suffers from a lack of established rules and standards, which can sometimes hinder the discovery and utilization of others' work. This is particularly true when authors, not traditionally scholars, contribute to the field without fully realizing their engagement with Digital Humanities, such as annotating information on maps. However, this openness also presents opportunities for individual experimentation and definition of what Digital Humanities means to each participant.

Looking forward, I am particularly excited about a project focusing on image corpora, a significant component of arts and humanities. Images are not merely repositories of documentary facts; they also encapsulate the perspectives and emotions of their creators. It will be fascinating to examine how different images depicting the same subjects can reveal underlying patterns through digital analysis.

In summary, Digital Humanities represents an experimental journey for me, unbound by traditional textbooks or methodologies. It encourages the exploration of patterns between seemingly unrelated phenomena using digital tools. In an era increasingly dominated by AI, Digital Humanities stands poised to extend the boundaries of what can be analyzed and understood within the realms of Arts and Humanities, embodying the fusion of technology and humanistic inquiry in a quest for deeper knowledge and understanding.
