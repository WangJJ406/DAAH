Meet the Marketing marvel of NYU Shanghai, a delightful concoction of wit, pranks, and epicurean pursuits, who ventured into this world on April 6, 2003. With a spirit as fiery as an Aries can muster, this junior student dives headlong into culinary adventures, orchestrates pranks with the finesse of a maestro, and champions the noble art of napping like it's a competitive sport.

Our hero abides by three golden rules: feast as though each meal is a farewell banquet, prank as if starring in a blockbuster comedy, and sleep with the dedication of a professional athlete in training. Life, in their eyes, is a grand buffet of laughter, dreams, and midnight snacks. Beware: joining their escapades may lead to unexpected side effects, including an insatiable appetite for life's zaniest pleasures.
